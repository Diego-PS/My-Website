    <h1 class="section-title">About me</h1>
    <p>I always loved logic problems, they require a rationalization process that 
      is very rewarding when you come up with a solution. 
      For that, math was my favorite subject at school, and I am really 
      good at it. Another thing that I have liked since my childhood is technology. 
      I remember playing games on my father’s computer, an old Windows 95 machine, 
      I could spend hours exploring its many softwares and trying to 
      figure out what they were for.</p>
    <p>
      When in high school, I had to think about what subject 
      I would choose for college, and I already knew 
      I was tending to Computer Science (CS), but 
      I didn’t even know how to print a Hello World, so in order to confirm that 
      I would be fine with CS, I started to learn how to code in C++, 
      enough for participating in the Olympiad of Informatics, and 
      I fell in love with Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in college, I realized that I was right about my choice. 
      Throughout the course I learned how computers work, 
      from their electric circuits to a high-level programming language. 
      In 2023, I was selected to participate in a one-year 
      Fellowship program with a company called Plank, where 
      I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in real products 
      for startups in Silicon Valley, and learned how to effectively 
      build various types of applications, including elements from backend, 
      frontend and infrastructure. I am now looking forward to continuing my 
      learning journey and working on new projects to make even more impact 
      with my code.

            Each fellowship cohort learns and collaborates closely as a team, working in-person from one of our Plank centers, under the direct supervision and mentorship of Plank’s senior engineers throughout the the fellowship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first 2 months of the fellowship involves intensive training in the cutting-edge languages, frameworks, services, and methodologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The training period is followed by 10 months of working directly with Plank’s commercial partners on real world projects, interacting with senior executives and industry leaders from around the world, and getting a front row seat to how fast growing companies build amazing products.

            From July 2021 until October 2022, I worked on the SINDH project, which involved analysis and mining of data from Disque Denúncia, in partnership with the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights (MMFDH), to obtain important insights to improve the service as a whole.

            From November 2022, I've worked on an open source software called Lemonade, a tool to facilitate data analysis by providing a visual block interface with the most common and useful functions from libraries such as Scikit-Learn. I've participated in the addition of new NLP functions into the app, by researching, implementing and documenting these new features.
